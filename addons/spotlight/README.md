# ARCOMM Config / Spotlight

This addon adds the main menu join button for the ARCOMM server. It adds two settings:
- Main Menu Spotlight - A selector between seeing gameplay clips or the ARCOMM logo on the screen. There is also a "Random" option which will choose randomly every time the game is started.
- Server Port - The port to connect to the ARCOMM server through. This should only be changed by modset-specific override mods.
